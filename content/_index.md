# FortiFlex FinOps Engineering Workshop

## Real-World Scenario: CloudSecure Solutions MSSP Challenge

**Company**: CloudSecure Solutions - A mid-sized MSSP serving 150+ enterprise customers

**The Challenge**: 
CloudSecure Solutions was struggling with their traditional Fortinet licensing model. Their customers had varying security needs that changed seasonally - retail customers needed additional protection during holiday seasons, financial services required scaling during quarterly reporting, and manufacturing clients had project-based security requirements.

**Pain Points**:
- **Procurement Delays**: Traditional licensing required 2-4 weeks lead time, missing customer opportunities
- **Over-provisioning Costs**: Customers paid for peak capacity year-round, leading to 40% waste during low-usage periods  
- **Manual Provisioning**: Each new customer deployment required manual license allocation, taking 3-5 business days
- **Billing Complexity**: Monthly reconciliation across different license types and customer usage patterns consumed 20+ hours of administrative work

**The FortiFlex Solution**:
With FortiFlex's usage-based licensing and API-driven automation, CloudSecure Solutions transformed their operations:
- **Instant Provisioning**: New customer deployments automated down to 15 minutes
- **Cost Optimization**: Customers now pay only for actual usage, reducing costs by 35%
- **Automated Scaling**: Seasonal traffic handled automatically without manual intervention
- **Streamlined Billing**: API integration with their billing system reduced admin overhead by 80%

**Workshop Goal**: Learn how to implement FortiFlex to solve similar challenges in your organization through hands-on experience with both manual operations and API automation.
