Thank you for joining our workshop!  We covered a lot of material in very little time.  As the is a 100 level course, one of the main goals is exposure to the FortiFlex Product while also providing examples of advanced use cases.

To that end, all of the materials used in today's workshop are freely available and will be generally kept up-to-date (on a best-effort basis) with product developments.  All of the Postman, Terraform, Python, etc is avaialble via links throughout this workshop, and provides a great starting point for additional learning and understanding.

Bookmark this workshop URL, as it will always be availalbe for future reference!

If you are intersted in learning more about implementing a FortiFlex Marketplace concept, please reach out to one of the Fortinet Cloud CSE instructors and/or your Account Management team.  Ask them to get you in touch with the [Cloud CSE team](mailto:fortinetcloudcse@fortinet.com) who build this FortiFlex Marketplace POC.
