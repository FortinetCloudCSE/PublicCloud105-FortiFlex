{{% notice warning %}}
We will be creating FortiFlex Configurations and Entitlements on the live/Production/customer facing FortiFlex System, and as mentioned, none of these entities can ever be deleted or cleaned up.

We've crafted this course to create a minimal infrastructure while still conveying the primarily FortiFlex learning points.  Please exercise caution while working through hands-on portion of the workshop and try not to create any extra configurations or entitlements than are necessary!  

Thanks for your consideration, and enjoy the workshop!
